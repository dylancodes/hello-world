Hi, I'm Dylan! I'm a 20-year-old developer with a passion for filmmaking and entrepreneurship. I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science with a communications minor at St. John's University in New York City. I'm skilled in all areas of video production as I have worked on a number of shoots including corporate, commercial, short film, music video, fashion, motion graphics, and more. I'm also skilled in numerous areas of programming as I have experience designing and coding web, software, and computer applications for both personal and business use.  

As an entrepreneur, I currently work as the owner of Ariscope, a strategic creative agency specializing in video production + web development for small to medium sized businesses. Besides Ariscope, I also work as the founder and co-executive director of Inner Impact, Inc. Inner Impact is a non-profit organization targeting teens ages 14-18 and aiming to positively impact their lives through various lifestyle development programs.
