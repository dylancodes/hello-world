Hi, I'm Dylan! I'm a 20-year-old software engineer. I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science with a communications minor at St. John's University in New York City. I have an interest in application, web, and software development, and I plan to break into mobile & Artificial Intelligence development in the future. Currently, my strongest programming languages include Java + HTML/CSS. I have fundamental knowledge in Ruby and SQL, and I'm currently learning Javascript as my second front-end language.
